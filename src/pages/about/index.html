      <h2>Meaning of 25/8</h2>
      <p>The rate of change in the web landscape is quite rapid where instead of 24/7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) we upped
        the ante.</p>
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p class="lead">We provide web solutions, fairly vague, let's try that again.</p>
      <p>If you haven't noticed, many businesses online rarely limit their activities to simply having a website. That is because
        it's tough to figure out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>where to start</li>
        <li>what you need</li>
        <li>how to make it happen</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>No matter the route you're looking to take online, having a web developer on hand is a wonderful thing.</p>

          <h3>Web Design</h3>
          <p>Art is art, but the difference between art and design is that design is meant to be functional. To keep all of
            the design functionally inline, we highly suggest the use of a design system.</p>

          <h3>Web Strategy</h3>
          <p>Things built and developed for the web can be delivered, but what makes the investment payoff on either front is
            a solid web strategy to back up the functional coherency.</p>
