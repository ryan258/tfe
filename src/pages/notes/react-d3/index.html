      <ul>
        <li>Who controls the damn?
          <em>who needs control of the dom?</em>
        </li>
        <li>React has a virtual DOM - to make updates, it needs control of the DOM</li>
        <li>D3 - makes data vizs for the web - obviously needs control of the DOM also
          <br>actually D3 only needs control of the DOM in 3 places
          <ul>
            <li>1st w/ transitions - animations from one state to the next</li>
            <li>in D3 we told you the 3 attributes you want to animate
              <ul>
                <li>XY Positions</li>
                <li>widths / heights</li>
                <li>colors</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>D3 calculates all of the in-between States, the interpolations, and then updates the attributes directly to the
              DOM
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>2nd is with Axes
          <ul>
            <li>we tell D3 exactly what we want</li>
            <li>d3 goes and renders it in the DOM for us</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finally there are
          <strong>brushes</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>D3 can also do layouts, geo, and shape</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>For many things we don't need to give D3 control of the DOM</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>instead we give it our raw data</li>
        <li>D3 gives back that same data,
          <strong>but with new information on top that will help us render the visualization</strong>
        </li>
        <li>and that's the power of D3 here,
          <strong>it transforms raw data, translates that data into screen space</strong>
        </li>
        <li>it abstracts away those common repetitive tasks for building data visualizations</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>In Most Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We can just have React to do the rendering</li>
        <li>and D3 do the calculation!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only exception being those 3 places (transitions, axes, and brushes), in which case you would want to have React do
        both the rendering and calculatons</p>
      <h2>Why? Isn't D3 enough to do the job?</h2>
      <p>Well, only if there are really simple hover, and click events and other simple interactions</p>
      <p>But if we want to take those interactions a step further...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we want to build whole UIs around our interactions, that's where React comes into play - sample app w/ them together
          @8:33
          <ul>
            <li>Update with each user manipulation of underlying data</li>
            <li>use react to manage updating my vizs w/ each user manipulation of the underlying data</li>
            <li>when user updates one thing and the rest update accordingly</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Use React With D3</h2>
      <p class="lead">to
        <strong>componentize</strong> visualizations and
        <strong>manage state</strong> as the user interacts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use React When You Want to Componentize the vizualizations</li>
        <li>when you need to manage state as a user is interacting</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Cool, HOW?!</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When you think of visualization components
          <strong>think of them as any self contained React component</strong>
        </li>
        <li>where you
          <strong>pass in raw data</strong>
        </li>
        <li>and the component will take that raw data</li>
        <li>and
          <strong>translate that data into screen space</strong>
        </li>
        <li>then render that data</li>
        <li>and manage any interactions w/ that
          <datagrid>data</datagrid>
        </li>
        <li>example at 14:27</li>
        <li>for the app component all that's done is in the render function and return the graph component, and an update button</li>
        <li>the app component is in charge of getting and updating the data everytime the user clicks the update button</li>
        <li>the graph component on the otherhand is in charge of getting the props from the parent - getting the data passing
          from the parent</li>
        <li>and using the D3 force layout to calculate the XY position of those nodes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Think of it like this</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>graph components are in charge of calculations</li>
        <li>calculating the data</li>
        <li>and only for those that are related to rendering the visualization itself</li>
        <li>anyother data calculations, manipulations, happen outside of the graph visualization component</li>
        <li>in this case, the app component</li>
        <li>She takes the data and uses it and loops through it</li>
        <li>and returns both SVG circles and line elements</li>
        <li>(in the render function)</li>
        <li>YOU DO THE CALCULATION BEFORE THE RENDER FUNCTION in the React lifecycle</li>
        <li>In this case
          <ul>
            <li>we'll mount the component and component will receive props</li>
            <li>for performance reasons - like using componentWillReceiveProps bc CWRP is only called when the parent passes
              and new props
              <em>or the other way to think about it if</em>
              <ul>
                <li>the user interaction has updated the data</li>
                <li>and it does not get called when setState is called on the component itself</li>
                <li>avoids unnecessary data recalculations</li>
                <li>and the added benefit of if you want to set state after the data, we can, the data calc, it doesn't trigger
                  an extaneous react lifecycle</li>
              </ul>

            </li>
            <h3>For the interaction</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>set the state on the selected node as state</li>
              <li>and my component in my click event callback</li>
              <li>do the calculations of figuring out which neon links are the neighors</li>
              <li>in the render function</li>
              <li>so that later on in the same render function you can use that data and figure out the opacity from the SVG
                circles and lines</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>another way to think about it</h3>
            <p>When React Renders - if the user interaction
              <strong>does</strong> propogate from parent, calculate in
              <strong>componentWillReceiveProps</strong>
            </p>
            <p>if interaction does
              <strong>not</strong> mutate data: set state in component, calculate in
              <strong>render</strong>
            </p>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Now the example is D3 doing the Rending and Calculations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>app component remains the same</li>
        <li>but the graph component has changed quite a bit
          <ul>
            <li>main difference being that in the render function where now instead of returning an SVG circle and a line</li>
            <li>all it's doing is returning an empty container</li>
            <li>the graph component takes that empty container element</li>
            <li>and it's wrapped in a D3 selection</li>
            <li>so that it can be rendered in the D3 render code later</li>
            <li>also call the calculate and render functions from componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate</li>
            <li>as for the calculation code - for calculating the graph data for figuring out XY positions - is the same as before</li>
            <li>the calculation for which neightbors to highlight has been taken out of the render function and is place into
              the component</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
